## TL;DR

**Project Cornelius** = Claude Code + Custom Agents + Obsidian + FAISS Vector Search

It's like having a highly specialized AI research assistant that:
- **Finds hidden connections** in your notes you didn't know existed
- **Writes articles** from your accumulated insights
- **Captures unique thoughts** while preserving your voice
- **Discovers patterns** across different domains of knowledge
- **Learns from you** - search rankings improve based on your actual usage
- **Researches autonomously** - can run research cycles and expand your knowledge base
- **Evolves with you** through Git-tracked configurations

## What is Project Cornelius?

Project Cornelius is a **multi-layered knowledge management system** that creates an intelligent bridge between your thinking and AI assistance. It's an agent-within-an-agent architecture that transforms Claude Code into a specialized second brain operator.

```

### Local Brain Search (`resources/local-brain-search/`)

FAISS-powered vector search with SYNAPSE-inspired memory architecture:

```bash
# Semantic search (static mode - fast)
./run_search.sh "dopamine motivation" --limit 10 --json

# Spreading activation search (better for synthesis queries)
./run_search.sh "how does dopamine relate to decision making" --mode spreading --json

# Find connections
./run_connections.sh "Note Name" --json

# Graph analytics
./run_connections.sh --hubs --json    # Most connected notes
./run_connections.sh --bridges --json  # Cross-domain connectors
./run_connections.sh --stats --json    # Graph statistics

# Learning system status
./run_learning.sh status              # Q-value stats
./run_learning.sh top                 # Top notes by learned relevance

# Re-index after changes
./run_index.sh
```

**Memory Architecture:**
- **Intent Classification** - Routes queries as factual/conceptual/synthesis/temporal
- **Spreading Activation** - Propagates relevance through graph with lateral inhibition
- **Usage-Based Learning** - Q-values adjust rankings based on what you actually use
- **Configuration** - Single source of truth in `memory_config.py`
